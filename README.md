# Reserve Classes - Back-end

> The project we built for the Final Capstone Project is based on an app to book an appointment to attend a class. We had to follow the given design of the website, but we personalize the content, i.e., instead of booking an appointment to try a motorcycle, we built an app to book an appointment to attend a class.
